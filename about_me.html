    <h1 class="colour-text">About Me</h1>
    <p class="colour-text">Hello! My name is Marios Tsourelas and I work as an IT Assistant at CMS S.A. With a strong passion for technology, I actively engage in programming and have developed various projects that I showcase on this website.

Besides technology, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and playing video games. One of my favorite hobbies is writing. Through this website, my goal is to share my professional journey and highlight my programming projects.

I believe that learning and growth are ongoing processes â€“ as the saying goes, "Rome wasn't built in a day." My aim is to continuously expand my knowledge and experiences to become better at what I love.</p>
